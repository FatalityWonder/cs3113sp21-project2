How to run:
Make clean
Make all
./project2 ALGORITHM n FILE 
      where n is the total allocation size

Sources = No sources used

Bugs: Unknown Bug causing the autograder to kill the program (could possibly be due to some inefficiencies in using a very large array, however this more accurately models the structure of memory)

assumptions : program will always read from a file
